Using datamapper and sqlite3 as a temporary database, we:

1. Download PowerSchool "autosend" staff and student files via SFTP
2. Process the files using datamapper and sqlite3
3. Upload the files in Edulink's format via SFTP

Should run this as a cron job on a daily basis.  Autosend source
files are posted daily.
